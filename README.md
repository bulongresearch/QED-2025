Hello! I'm Bu. This is my 2025 QED Senior Division Project!

If you would like to see results, please see the folders "graphs" and "csvs"

If you would like to actually run the files, please do so in the following order:

1. data_generation.py
2. train_base_model.py
3. naive_multi_seed.py
4. devs_multi_seed.py
5. devs_final_analysis.py

Note: Files may take a long time to run.
